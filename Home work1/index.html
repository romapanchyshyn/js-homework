        <h1>Kangaroo</h1>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            The <strong> kangaroo </strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
            (macropods, meaning "large foot"). In common use the term is used to describe
            the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus <i>Macropus</i>:
            the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo.<sup>[1]</sup>
            Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million
            kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million
            one year earlier.<sup>[2]</sup>
            As with the terms "wallaroo" and "wallaby", "kangaroo" refers to a polyphyletic
            grouping of species. All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae,
            and are distinguished according to size. The largest species in the family are called
            "kangaroos" and the smallest are generally called "wallabies". The term "wallaroos"
            refers to species of an intermediate size.<sup>[3]</sup> There is also the tree-kangaroo, another
            genus of macropod, which inhabits the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern
            Queensland and some of the islands in the region. A general idea of the relative size of
            these informal terms could be:
            <ul>
                <li>wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; The dwarf wallaby
                    (the smallest member) length is 46 cm and weigh of 1.6 kg;</li>
                <li>tree-kangaroos: from Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo body and head length
                    of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weigh of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg
                    (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo length of 75–90 cm
                    (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg (18–33 lb);</li>
                <li>wallaroos: the <i>black wallaroo</i>, the smallest by far, with a tail length of 60–70 cm
                    and weight of 19–22 kg for males and 13 kg for females;</li>
                <li>kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).</li>
            </ul>
